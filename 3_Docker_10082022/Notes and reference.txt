1.Docker image and cotainer e.g What is container
2.Some basic commands with dockers
3.Creaate docker image
4.Run it as a container



Differents b/w docker images and container?


multiple layer in the docer image:

Each layer has subimage and dependencies with previuos

Consider as bwlow:

Base image/os will run the 
Python image
requirement.txt image
mongo DB

Combined all these called images or artificates


Suppose pass this image to another person 

When another person run the image 

Will extarct as container and run in his host machine

He can run more than one container

His host machine has 65000 ports

Every image mab be different base os like windows,ubuntu


Whenever I run image it became as container

Docker:

Docker image is a package or artifiate
we can move or share this image

Container:

Save the image in host and run it became as container
Internally separte isolated container will create


Container can't be shared.


Docker image needs to updated whenever update required and needs to be shared

can we run multiple images on a single container ?

no


Docker use host os kernal .so we can virtual only application

But VM has own kernal & application - that why we need to allocate memory and cpu. So we need to virtual both.


Docker is fast becasue . it's very small ,it's like mb size, dose not care about os kernal.

Starting and running - docker is fast. But in vm we need to intinalize lot before starting , like allocate cpu,memory.

Docker is compatability issue. VM can install any machine.


Docker run -d -p 80:8000 docker/gertting started

80 is host port
8000 is container port


open the browser & Test 

http://192.168.99.100:8000/

Here 8000 is host port


Hello word Program:

. /app  - Copy all folder and file into workdir of docker

Keep the working directory




Create the docker:
==================
Create the docker file

FROM python:3.7
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python","app.py"]


Here RUN for install cmd is run the application


build the docker image

$ docker build -t welcome .                      welcome is image name 
t meens peseudo-tty kind of tag    last . is build in current local directory


now we can see one by installion happening

Now entire docker image created


Check docker images we can see welcome-app

Ensure that app.py app.run (host='0.0.0.0',port=5000)

some time windows 127.0.0.1

How to run the image:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 welcome-app



Delete the image:

docker stop image_running_id

docker rmi -f image-name




check Running docker:

docker ps
 
docker image checking:

docker images

stop the docker image or

docker stop container id



How to change the code & build?

Stop
remove  using docker rmi -f image-nam
build 
run


How to push?

docker build -t thangarajd/welcome-app . ( may be thangarajd - user name)

after that we can see

docker images thagarajd/welcome-all


docker push thangarajd/welcome-app:latest   default will take 

Will ask username and password




How other person will pull?

docker pull thangarajd/welcome-app


How the other person run??

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 thangarajd/welcome-app


http://192.168.99.100:5000/


Go to Docker hub  - Edit the readme file and give how to run info.


in short:

docker run -d -p host port:container port image
docker push <username>/docker image

Instead of hardcode the port we can use docker file EXPOSE 5000  command to port expose.

may be we need to create the repo in dockerhub & then push
